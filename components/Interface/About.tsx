              This is a simple tic tac toe game built with Next.js and React,
              and styled with Sass.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              The game is built with a simple state management system, and the
              game board is rendered with a simple for loop.

              Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns
              marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in
              placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or
              vertical row is the winner.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from
              both players.
            </p>

            <h1 className={styles.about__title}>How to Play</h1>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              The game is played on a grid that&apos;s 3 squares by 3 squares.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.
              Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across,
              or diagonally) is the winner.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3
              marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.about__text}>
              You can play the game against the computer, or you can play
              against a friend.
